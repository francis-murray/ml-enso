# Machine Learning Approaches to Predict the El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation

## Project Objectives
This work aims to advance the understanding and application of Machine Learning approaches in predicting the El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation by focusing on the following key objectives:
1. Investigate Graph Structure Generation Methods: Explore and evaluate various methods for generating graph structures that can effectively capture and represent the complex relationships within and between climate fields [[*Tsonis, Swanson, and Roebber, 2006*](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-87-5-585)].
2. Select the Optimal Earth System Models (ESMs) for Transfer Learning: Apply intuition from modeling studies [[*Rivera Tello, Takahashi, and Karamperidou, 2023*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45739-3)] to select ESMs whose modes of variability most accurately represent the diversity of El Ni単o events, with the aim of improving predictive performance.
3. Apply GNNs to the prediction of various ENSO flavors: Use data derived from the selected ESM outputs to train GNNs to more accurately predict the Eastern and Central Pacific El Ni単o events.
4. Enhance the Interpretability of Trained Models: Use explainability techniques [[*Samek et al., 2019*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6)] to better understand the underlying factors influencing the predictions made by GNN models.
